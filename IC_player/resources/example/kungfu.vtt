00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.138
Legend tells of a legendary warrior...

2
00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:42.868
...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

3
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.572
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

4
00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:04.124
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!

5
00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:07.723
The warrior said nothing.
for his mouth was full.

6
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.963
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

7
00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:13.335
Enough talk. Let's fight!

8
00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.839
Shashabooey!

9
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.641
He was so deadly in fact.

10
00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:23.409
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

11
00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.677
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

12
00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:28.515
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

13
00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.755
There is no charge for awesomeness.

14
00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.452
Or attractiveness.

15
00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:35.789
Kablooey!

16
00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.591
It mattered not how many foes he faced.

17
00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:41.531
They were no match for his bodacity!

18
00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:58.710
Never before had a panda
been so feared! And so loved.

19
00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.281
Even the most heroic heroes in China.

20
00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:04.585
the Furious Five.

21
00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.592
bowed in respect
to this great master.

22
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.491
We should hang out.

23
00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:10.688
Agreed.

24
00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:15.693
But hanging out would have to wait.

25
00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:20.205
Because when you're facing
the 10.000 demons of Demon Mountain.

26
00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:23.070
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

27
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.901
Po! Get up!

28
00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:26.740
You'll be later for work!

29
00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.074
What?

30
00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:36.851
Po! Get up!

31
00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:55.662
Po. What are you doing up there?

32
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:57.003
Nothing.

33
00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:04.277
Monkey! Mantis! Orange! Viper! Tigress!

34
00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:14.021
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

35
00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.458
Coming!

36
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:26.997
Sorry. Dad.

37
00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.906
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

38
00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:32.341
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

39
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:34.902
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

40
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.208
About what?

41
00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:37.874
What were you dreaming about?

42
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.474
What was I?

43
00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.310
I was dreaming about...

44
00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:45.345
...noodles.

45
00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:49.488
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

46
00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.122
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

47
00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:54.666
Careful! That soup is sharp.

48
00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.201
Oh. happy day!

49
00:03:56.268 --> 00:04:00.170
My son. finally having the noodle dream!

50
00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:05.567
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

51
00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:07.509
This is a sign. Po.

52
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.377
A sign of what?

53
00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:14.078
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

54
00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.417
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

55
00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.620
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

56
00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:25.186
As I took it over from my father.
who took it over from his father...

57
00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:27.926
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.

58
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.696
Dad. Dad. Dad. it was just a dream.

59
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.068
No. it was the dream.

60
00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.700
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

61
00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:40.678
But. Dad. didn't you ever want
to do something else?

62
00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:42.611
Something besides noodles?

63
00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:45.616
Actually. when I was young and crazy.

64
00:04:45.684 --> 00:04:49.745
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

65
00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:50.948
Why didn't you?

66
00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:52.786
Because it was a stupid dream.

67
00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.995
Can you imagine me making tofu?

68
00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.492
Tofu.

69
00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:02.966
No! We all have our place in this world.

70
00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:05.595
Mine is here. and yours is...

71
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:06.899
I know. is here.

72
00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:10.100
No. it's at tables 2. 5. 7. and 12

73
00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:12.235
Service with a smile.

74
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.840
Well done. students...
if you were trying to disappoint me.

75
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.074
Tigress. you need more ferocity!
Monkey. greater speed.

76
00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:52.049
Orange. height. Viper. subtlety.
Mantis...

77
00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.948
- Master Shifu.
- What?!

78
00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:56.453
It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.

79
00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:10.802
Master Oogway. you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

80
00:06:17.142 --> 00:06:21.579
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

81
00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.774
So. nothing's wrong?

82
00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.477
Well. I didn't say that.

83
00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:46.199
You were saying?

84
00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:49.365
I have had a vision.

85
00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:52.171
Tai Lung will return.

86
00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:59.676
That is impossible! He is in prison.

87
00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:02.516
Nothing is impossible.

88
00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.378
Zeng!

89
00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:06.788
Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them

90
00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:10.192
to double the guards. double
their weapons. double everything!

91
00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:12.162
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

92
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.698
Yes. Master Shifu!

93
00:07:15.534 --> 00:07:20.699
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

94
00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:24.766
We must do something! We can't let him
march on the valley. take his revenge!

95
00:07:24.843 --> 00:07:25.832
He'll...

96
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.209
Your mind is like this water.
my friend.

97
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.716
When it is agitated.
it becomes difficult to see.

98
00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:34.882
But if you allow it to settle...

99
00:07:35.287 --> 00:07:37.949
...the answer becomes clear.

100
00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:43.056
The Dragon Scroll.

101
00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:45.487
It is time.

102
00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:50.297
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

103
00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:55.102
To become the Dragon Warrior?

104
00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:56.641
I don't know.

105
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.403
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

106
00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:02.337
Watch it!

107
00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:03.904
Sorry. Suck it up!

108
00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:08.081
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

109
00:08:08.153 --> 00:08:09.142
What?

110
00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:14.521
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

111
00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:19.189
Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of
the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

112
00:08:19.264 --> 00:08:22.324
We've waited 1.000 years for this!
Take the bowl!

113
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:26.531
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history! Just go!

114
00:08:26.605 --> 00:08:28.596
Po! Where are you going?

115
00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.840
To the Jade Palace.

116
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.208
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

117
00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:38.841
The whole valley will be there.
and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

118
00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:40.316
Selling noodles?

119
00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:45.422
But. Dad. I was thinking. maybe I...

120
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:47.618
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...

121
00:08:51.463 --> 00:08:56.025
...could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

122
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.796
That's my boy!

123
00:08:57.903 --> 00:09:00.133
I told you that dream was a sign.

124
00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:03.141
Yeah. Glad I had it.

125
00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:09.746
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me. too!

126
00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:12.340
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

127
00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.616
Come on. Come on!

128
00:09:49.688 --> 00:09:51.553
Almost there.

129
00:09:51.623 --> 00:09:52.783
What?

130
00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:55.520
No! Oh. no!

131
00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:01.424
- Sorry. Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

132
00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:09.363
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

133
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.979
It is an historic day.

134
00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:17.811
Isn't it. Master Oogway?

135
00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:22.752
Yes. and one I feared
I would not live to see.

136
00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:24.812
Are your students ready?

137
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.653
Yes. Master Oogway.

138
00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:29.555
Know this. old friend.

139
00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:33.962
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley...

140
00:10:34.032 --> 00:10:36.660
...but also to you.

141
00:10:40.372 --> 00:10:40.472
Let the tournament begin!

142
00:10:40.472 --> 00:10:44.135
Let the tournament begin!

143
00:10:55.587 --> 00:10:56.952
Yeah.

144
00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:00.686
No. no. wait!

145
00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:03.091
I'm coming! Wait. wait!

146
00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.390
Yes!

147
00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:09.765
Hey! Open the door!

148
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.764
Let me in!

149
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.400
Citizens of the Valley of Peace.

150
00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:21.173
it is my great honor
to present to you... Tigress!

151
00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:25.410
Viper! Orange! Monkey! Mantis!

152
00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:26.815
The Furious Five!

153
00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.065
Yeah. the Furious Five!

154
00:11:43.368 --> 00:11:44.699
Warriors. prepare!

155
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.330
Wait. No. Oh. peeky-hole.

156
00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:48.737
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

157
00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:52.800
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

158
00:11:55.113 --> 00:11:56.239
Look at that.

159
00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:58.306
Hey! Get out of the way!

160
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.851
And finally Master Tigress!

161
00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:40.691
And believe me. citizens.
you have not seen anything yet.

162
00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.021
I know!

163
00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:47.191
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

164
00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:04.048
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.

165
00:13:09.187 --> 00:13:12.213
Citizens of the Valley of Peace.

166
00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:16.819
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

167
00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:19.957
Oh. no! No. no. wait!

168
00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:22.723
Yeah.

169
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.275
Po!

170
00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:42.286
What are you doing?!

171
00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.914
What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!

172
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.924
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

173
00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:54.358
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

174
00:13:55.233 --> 00:13:58.259
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles. Dad.

175
00:14:01.073 --> 00:14:04.600
I love kung fu!

176
00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:21.624
Come on. son. Let's get back to work.

177
00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:25.628
OK.

178
00:14:31.703 --> 00:14:33.466
Come back!

179
00:14:57.696 --> 00:14:59.493
What's going on?

180
00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:01.926
Where?

181
00:15:04.436 --> 00:15:05.994
What are you pointing?

182
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.731
OK. Sorry.

183
00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:13.277
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

184
00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:15.279
How interesting.

185
00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:18.646
Master. are you pointing at me?

186
00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:20.742
- Him.
- Who?

187
00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.949
- You.
- Me?

188
00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:30.518
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

189
00:15:30.762 --> 00:15:32.195
- What?
- What?!

190
00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:33.959
- What?!
- What?!

191
00:15:43.842 --> 00:15:46.436
Stop. wait! Who told you to?

192
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.450
Master Oogway. wait.

193
00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:01.788
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

194
00:16:01.827 --> 00:16:05.558
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

195
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.063
That was just an accident!

196
00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.896
There are no accidents.

197
00:16:25.016 --> 00:16:27.780
Forgive us. Master. We have failed you.

198
00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:31.186
No. If the panda
has not quit by morning

199
00:16:31.256 --> 00:16:33.588
then I will have failed you.

200
00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:54.607
Wait! Wait. wait. wait!
I bring a message...

201
00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:56.943
...from Master Shifu.

202
00:17:01.686 --> 00:17:02.778
What?!

203
00:17:02.854 --> 00:17:04.185
"Double the guard?!"

204
00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:06.053
"Extra precautions?!"

205
00:17:06.124 --> 00:17:08.456
"Your prison may not be adequate?!"

206
00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:15.021
You doubt my prison security?!

207
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.965
Absolutely not.

208
00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:20.163
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

209
00:17:20.238 --> 00:17:23.867
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

210
00:17:24.509 --> 00:17:27.637
Escape from Chorh-Gom prison
is impossible!

211
00:17:32.884 --> 00:17:34.818
Impressive. isn't it?

212
00:17:35.787 --> 00:17:37.584
It's very impressive.

213
00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:39.146
It's very impressive.

214
00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:41.886
One way in. one way out.

215
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.056
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

216
00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:48.656
Yes. except that prisoner...

217
00:17:48.733 --> 00:17:50.428
...is Tai Lung.

218
00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:56.235
Take us down.

219
00:18:01.746 --> 00:18:03.111
What are you doing?

220
00:18:14.459 --> 00:18:15.926
Oh. my.

221
00:18:20.198 --> 00:18:23.258
Behold Tai Lung.

222
00:18:24.936 --> 00:18:27.996
I'm just gonna wait right here.

223
00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:32.373
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

224
00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:34.708
Crossbows! At the ready!

225
00:18:34.779 --> 00:18:36.576
Crossbows?

226
00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:39.208
Hey. tough guy. did you hear?

227
00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:43.778
Oogway’s giving someone the Dragon
Scroll. and it's not gonna be you.

228
00:18:43.855 --> 00:18:45.516
Don't get him mad.

229
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:50.391
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

230
00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:58.592
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

231
00:18:58.703 --> 00:19:00.500
I'm good. I've seen enough.

232
00:19:00.538 --> 00:19:02.972
I'll tell Shifu he
has nothing to worry about.

233
00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.269
No. he doesn't.

234
00:19:04.342 --> 00:19:06.572
I'll tell him that.

235
00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.510
Can we please go now?

236
00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:26.998
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

237
00:19:26.998 --> 00:19:27.521
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

238
00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:34.671
Wait a second!

239
00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:44.342
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

240
00:19:47.285 --> 00:19:50.618
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

241
00:19:51.589 --> 00:19:53.022
Look at this place.

242
00:19:55.193 --> 00:19:59.630
Master Flying Rhino's armor.
with authentic battle damage!

243
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.561
The Sword of Heroes!

244
00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:06.900
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking.

245
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.636
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

246
00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:16.475
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

247
00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:24.312
No!

248
00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:28.421
The legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

249
00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:31.656
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu Army.

250
00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:36.159
Hello.

251
00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:38.566
Have you finished sight-seeing?

252
00:20:38.636 --> 00:20:40.729
Sorry. I should have come to you first.

253
00:20:40.805 --> 00:20:42.773
My patience is wearing thin.

254
00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:45.674
Well. I mean. it's not like you
were going anywhere.

255
00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:48.110
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

256
00:20:48.179 --> 00:20:49.203
How's it going?

257
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.714
How do you get 5.000...
Master Shifu!

258
00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:56.082
Someone... broke that.

259
00:20:56.154 --> 00:20:58.520
But I'll fix it. Do you have some...

260
00:20:59.491 --> 00:21:00.685
...glue?

261
00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:04.684
A splinter.

262
00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:07.755
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?

263
00:21:07.832 --> 00:21:10.960
- I guess so.
- Wrong!

264
00:21:11.035 --> 00:21:14.766
You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will
never be the Dragon Warrior until...

265
00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:17.774
...you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

266
00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:22.412
So. how does this work?

267
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.381
Do you have a ladder.
or a trampoline. or?

268
00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:30.745
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

269
00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:32.722
- to limitless power?
- No. I...

270
00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:35.817
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

271
00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:39.955
And that is impossible
if that one is someone like you.

272
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:41.055
Someone like me?

273
00:21:41.132 --> 00:21:45.796
Yes. look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

274
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.338
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

275
00:21:48.406 --> 00:21:51.239
And this ridiculous belly.

276
00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:54.574
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

277
00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.807
Now. wait a minute.
That's uncalled for.

278
00:21:56.881 --> 00:21:59.406
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

279
00:21:59.517 --> 00:22:01.382
Listen. Oogway said I was...

280
00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:04.115
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

281
00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:06.919
Oh. you know this hold?

282
00:22:06.991 --> 00:22:09.653
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty.

283
00:22:09.727 --> 00:22:12.491
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

284
00:22:13.364 --> 00:22:16.026
- No. no!
- You know the hardest part of this?

285
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.968
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

286
00:22:20.038 --> 00:22:22.165
OK. OK. take it easy.

287
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.674
Now listen closely. panda.

288
00:22:24.742 --> 00:22:27.870
Oogway may have picked you.
but when I'm through with you.

289
00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:32.849
I promise you. you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

290
00:22:33.017 --> 00:22:36.145
Yeah. we're clear. We're so clear.

291
00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:37.950
Good.

292
00:22:38.022 --> 00:22:39.956
I can't wait to get started.

293
00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:21.828
- Let's begin.
- Wait. wait. wait.

294
00:23:22.133 --> 00:23:23.430
What?

295
00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:27.471
- Now?
- Yes. now.

296
00:23:27.538 --> 00:23:31.838
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

297
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.468
Oh. OK. well...

298
00:23:33.544 --> 00:23:37.537
I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

299
00:23:37.615 --> 00:23:40.379
Well. if we don't try.
we'll never know. will we?

300
00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:44.285
Yeah. it's just. maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

301
00:23:44.355 --> 00:23:45.413
What level is that?

302
00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.948
Well. I'm not a master. but...

303
00:23:49.027 --> 00:23:51.791
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.

304
00:23:51.863 --> 00:23:55.959
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

305
00:23:56.034 --> 00:23:58.798
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

306
00:23:58.903 --> 00:24:03.966
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

307
00:24:04.008 --> 00:24:05.373
But if you insist...

308
00:24:05.443 --> 00:24:08.207
The Furious Five!

309
00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:12.545
You're bigger than your action figures.
Except. you. Mantis. You're the same.

310
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.380
Go ahead. panda.
Show us what you can do.

311
00:24:20.258 --> 00:24:23.625
Are they gonna watch. or should I wait
till they get back to work?

312
00:24:23.695 --> 00:24:24.684
Hit it.

313
00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:29.426
OK. yeah. I mean. I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

314
00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.266
So my kung fu might not be
as good as... later on.

315
00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:34.464
Just hit it.

316
00:24:35.306 --> 00:24:36.432
All right.

317
00:24:37.408 --> 00:24:40.809
What you got? You got nothing.
'cause I got it right here.

318
00:24:40.878 --> 00:24:43.904
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

319
00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:46.177
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.

320
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.242
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

321
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.117
You've only seen praying mantis.

322
00:24:51.189 --> 00:24:53.123
Or monkey style.

323
00:24:53.791 --> 00:24:56.123
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

324
00:24:56.194 --> 00:24:58.560
Would you hit it!

325
00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:00.790
All right. All right.

326
00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:09.598
Why don't you try again?
A little harder.

327
00:25:11.342 --> 00:25:12.604
How's that?

328
00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:24.878
That hurts.

329
00:25:31.896 --> 00:25:34.057
This will be easier than I thought.

330
00:25:34.132 --> 00:25:36.623
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

331
00:25:37.468 --> 00:25:38.765
Those are hard!

332
00:25:43.141 --> 00:25:44.574
My tenders.

333
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.365
How did I do?

334
00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:18.239
There is now a level zero.

335
00:26:18.309 --> 00:26:18.409
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

336
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:20.707
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

337
00:26:20.778 --> 00:26:23.110
What was Master Oogway thinking?

338
00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:25.479
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

339
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.041
He is so mighty!

340
00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:32.954
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire!

341
00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:35.857
When he walks. the very ground shakes!

342
00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:41.127
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

343
00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:43.224
Yeah. or could at least touch his toes.

344
00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:45.701
Or even see his toes.

345
00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:11.221
OK.

346
00:27:20.037 --> 00:27:21.664
Great.

347
00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:38.113
Hi. You're up.

348
00:27:38.189 --> 00:27:39.588
I am now.

349
00:27:39.757 --> 00:27:41.156
I was just...

350
00:27:41.225 --> 00:27:43.125
Some day. huh?

351
00:27:43.194 --> 00:27:47.597
That kung fu stuff is hard work. right?
Are your biceps sore?

352
00:27:48.633 --> 00:27:53.434
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day. so...

353
00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:57.505
Yeah. I should probably
get to sleep now.

354
00:27:57.608 --> 00:28:00.042
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. Of course.
- OK. thanks.

355
00:28:00.077 --> 00:28:02.944
It's just...
Man. I'm such a big fan!

356
00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:05.710
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

357
00:28:05.783 --> 00:28:09.275
Outnumbered a thousand to one.
but you didn't stop. You just...

358
00:28:12.056 --> 00:28:14.388
Sorry about that.

359
00:28:14.458 --> 00:28:16.949
Look. you don't belong here.

360
00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:21.564
I know. I know. You're right.

361
00:28:21.632 --> 00:28:24.123
I don't have... I just...

362
00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:25.726
My whole life I dreamed of...

363
00:28:25.803 --> 00:28:30.672
No. I meant you don't belong here.
I mean. in this room. This is my room.

364
00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:34.102
Property of Orange.

365
00:28:34.178 --> 00:28:36.043
OK. Right. right.

366
00:28:36.113 --> 00:28:38.638
So. you want to get to sleep.

367
00:28:38.716 --> 00:28:40.513
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

368
00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:42.712
We got big things tomorrow.

369
00:28:42.787 --> 00:28:46.985
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

370
00:28:50.828 --> 00:28:51.988
What was that?

371
00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.496
I didn't say anything.

372
00:28:53.564 --> 00:28:55.725
OK. All right. Good night.

373
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.994
Sleep well.

374
00:28:59.804 --> 00:29:01.669
That seemed a little awkward.

375
00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:06.132
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

376
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:08.906
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah. of course.

377
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.277
This is your room.

378
00:29:10.348 --> 00:29:13.647
I mean. you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

379
00:29:13.718 --> 00:29:16.084
You're a disgrace to kung fu.
and if you have

380
00:29:16.153 --> 00:29:19.782
any respect for who we are
and what we do.

381
00:29:20.124 --> 00:29:22.285
you will be gone by morning.

382
00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:29.359
Big fan!

383
00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:40.608
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

384
00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:47.646
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

385
00:29:47.718 --> 00:29:52.655
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

386
00:29:52.723 --> 00:29:56.716
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

387
00:29:57.995 --> 00:30:00.395
So why are you so upset?

388
00:30:05.536 --> 00:30:09.063
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

389
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.769
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

390
00:30:12.843 --> 00:30:13.935
Probably.

391
00:30:14.011 --> 00:30:17.708
And the Five! Man. you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

392
00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:18.771
Totally.

393
00:30:18.849 --> 00:30:22.910
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

394
00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:26.956
I mean. I'm not like the Five.

395
00:30:27.024 --> 00:30:30.585
I've got no claws. no wings. no venom.

396
00:30:30.661 --> 00:30:33.596
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

397
00:30:35.199 --> 00:30:38.600
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

398
00:30:41.772 --> 00:30:43.933
Quit. don't quit.

399
00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:48.035
Noodles. don't noodles.

400
00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:52.776
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

401
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.715
There's a saying:

402
00:30:54.785 --> 00:30:57.219
Yesterday is history.

403
00:30:57.321 --> 00:30:59.755
tomorrow is a mystery.

404
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.918
but today is a gift.

405
00:31:02.993 --> 00:31:05.791
That is why it is called the present.

406
00:31:35.793 --> 00:31:38.159
- Oh. no!
- What's happening?!

407
00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:40.720
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

408
00:31:49.473 --> 00:31:51.100
Fire crossbows!

409
00:31:51.175 --> 00:31:52.506
Fire!

410
00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:56.170
Fire!

411
00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:06.517
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

412
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.423
- Not going anywhere! Neither is he!
- Let go of me!

413
00:32:09.493 --> 00:32:10.619
Bring it up!

414
00:32:13.364 --> 00:32:14.854
Wait! Bring it back!

415
00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:37.644
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

416
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:48.620
We're dead. So very. very dead.

417
00:33:49.326 --> 00:33:51.385
Not yet we're not. Now!

418
00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:41.772
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

419
00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:04.032
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

420
00:35:06.303 --> 00:35:09.136
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

421
00:35:09.206 --> 00:35:11.231
Fly back there and tell them...

422
00:35:11.308 --> 00:35:15.039
...the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

423
00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:28.548
Good morning. Master!

424
00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:31.654
Panda!

425
00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:32.718
Panda!

426
00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:34.291
Wake up!

427
00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.063
He's quit.

428
00:35:41.071 --> 00:35:46.134
What do we do now. with the panda gone?
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

429
00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.304
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time.

430
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.008
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

431
00:35:53.517 --> 00:35:55.041
What are you doing here?!

432
00:35:55.986 --> 00:35:57.977
Hi! Good morning. Master!

433
00:35:58.088 --> 00:35:59.953
I thought I'd warm up a little.

434
00:36:02.092 --> 00:36:03.081
You're stuck.

435
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.526
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

436
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:09.328
Nah. This is one of my...
Yeah. I'm stuck.

437
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.334
- Help him.
- Oh. dear.

438
00:36:12.469 --> 00:36:14.937
Maybe on three. One. two...

439
00:36:16.006 --> 00:36:17.200
...three.

440
00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:20.637
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

441
00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:23.646
- No. really. I appreciate...
- Ever.

442
00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:28.014
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

443
00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:31.452
It takes years to develop
one's flexibility!

444
00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:35.288
And years longer to apply it in combat!

445
00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:46.226
Put that down!

446
00:36:46.303 --> 00:36:50.797
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

447
00:36:50.874 --> 00:36:53.809
Yeah! Excellent.

448
00:36:54.611 --> 00:36:55.805
Let's get started.

449
00:36:58.115 --> 00:36:59.980
- Are you ready?
- I was born re...

450
00:37:01.952 --> 00:37:04.944
I'm sorry. brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

451
00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:08.321
That was awesome! Let's go again!

452
00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:37.620
I've been taking it easy on you. panda.
But no more.

453
00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:40.020
Your next opponent will be me.

454
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.853
All right! Yeah. let's go!

455
00:37:44.361 --> 00:37:46.420
Step forth.

456
00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:49.955
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness...

457
00:37:50.033 --> 00:37:51.898
...and make him suffer for it.

458
00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:53.300
Oh. yeah!

459
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:56.737
To take his strength
and use it against him...

460
00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:59.298
...until he finally falls...

461
00:37:59.409 --> 00:38:00.398
...or quits.

462
00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:02.435
A real warrior never quits.

463
00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:05.710
Don't worry. Master. I will never quit!

464
00:38:16.093 --> 00:38:19.290
If he's smart.
he won't come back up those steps.

465
00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:20.694
But he will.

466
00:38:20.764 --> 00:38:23.062
He's not going to quit. is he?

467
00:38:23.133 --> 00:38:25.897
He's not going to quit bouncing.
I'll tell you that.

468
00:38:37.781 --> 00:38:40.841
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

469
00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:41.942
Trust me. it will.

470
00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:45.648
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

471
00:38:45.722 --> 00:38:48.384
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

472
00:38:48.458 --> 00:38:49.447
Sure you were.

473
00:38:49.526 --> 00:38:53.587
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

474
00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:55.754
I'm over here.

475
00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:59.301
Maybe you should look at this again.

476
00:38:59.403 --> 00:39:01.803
Oh. OK.

477
00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:06.599
Stop it. Stop!

478
00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:10.713
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all...

479
00:39:11.048 --> 00:39:14.711
...but if I didn't know better.
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

480
00:39:19.656 --> 00:39:22.056
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

481
00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:24.661
...but he wasn't always like that.

482
00:39:24.728 --> 00:39:26.059
According to legend.

483
00:39:26.129 --> 00:39:30.657
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

484
00:39:30.734 --> 00:39:32.668
- No!
- Yes.

485
00:39:32.736 --> 00:39:33.998
But that was before.

486
00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:36.062
Before what?

487
00:39:36.139 --> 00:39:37.470
Before Tai Lung.

488
00:39:37.574 --> 00:39:40.134
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

489
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:43.202
Well. if he's going to stay here.
he should know.

490
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.214
Guys. guys. I know about Tai Lung.

491
00:39:45.282 --> 00:39:50.743
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

492
00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:54.985
And then he turned bad.
and now he's in jail.

493
00:39:55.058 --> 00:39:57.185
He wasn’t just a student.

494
00:40:01.531 --> 00:40:04.364
Shifu found him as a cub...

495
00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:08.938
...and he raised him as his son.

496
00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:14.368
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu...

497
00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:17.743
...Shifu trained him.

498
00:40:17.814 --> 00:40:21.944
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

499
00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:25.383
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

500
00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.717
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

501
00:40:29.793 --> 00:40:34.093
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

502
00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:38.128
Outraged. Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

503
00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:42.629
He tried to take the scroll by force.

504
00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:47.302
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

505
00:40:49.279 --> 00:40:50.837
But how could he?

506
00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:09.159
Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.

507
00:41:17.407 --> 00:41:18.669
Or since.

508
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:30.017
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

509
00:41:30.087 --> 00:41:32.317
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

510
00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:35.415
And he's stuck with you.

511
00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:39.360
A big fat panda
who treats it like a joke.

512
00:41:40.263 --> 00:41:41.252
That is it!

513
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:44.459
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

514
00:41:46.903 --> 00:41:49.371
And may have also stopped his heart.

515
00:41:53.043 --> 00:41:54.601
Inner peace.

516
00:41:55.879 --> 00:41:57.870
Inner peace.

517
00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:02.546
Inner...

518
00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:06.054
Inner peace.

519
00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:13.554
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?!

520
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.062
Inner...

521
00:42:22.672 --> 00:42:24.731
Oh. Zeng.

522
00:42:24.808 --> 00:42:26.400
Excellent.

523
00:42:26.476 --> 00:42:28.410
I could use some good news right now.

524
00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:37.551
Master! Master!

525
00:42:38.221 --> 00:42:42.487
I have... It's...
It's very bad news.

526
00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:44.925
Shifu.

527
00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:48.396
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

528
00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:52.128
Master. your vision.
Your vision was right.

529
00:42:52.202 --> 00:42:55.603
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

530
00:42:57.074 --> 00:42:59.804
That is bad news...

531
00:42:59.876 --> 00:43:04.210
...if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

532
00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:08.547
The panda? Master.
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

533
00:43:08.618 --> 00:43:11.917
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

534
00:43:11.988 --> 00:43:14.286
There are no accidents.

535
00:43:15.525 --> 00:43:18.653
Yes. I know. You've said that already.

536
00:43:18.728 --> 00:43:22.926
- Twice.
- Well. that was no accident. either.

537
00:43:22.999 --> 00:43:24.091
Thrice.

538
00:43:24.167 --> 00:43:25.794
My old friend.

539
00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:30.465
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny. nor you yours.

540
00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.101
until you let go
of the illusion of control.

541
00:43:34.177 --> 00:43:35.542
Illusion?

542
00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:38.604
Yes. Look at this tree. Shifu.

543
00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:41.708
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me.

544
00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:45.050
nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

545
00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:47.647
But there are things we can control.

546
00:43:48.725 --> 00:43:51.819
I can control when the fruit will fall.

547
00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.591
And I can control...

548
00:43:55.665 --> 00:43:57.656
...where to plant the seed.

549
00:43:58.168 --> 00:44:00.261
That is no illusion. Master.

550
00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:03.896
Yes.

551
00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:06.374
But no matter what you do

552
00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:09.378
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

553
00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:14.315
You may wish for an apple or an orange.
but you will get a peach.

554
00:44:14.384 --> 00:44:18.013
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

555
00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:20.750
Maybe it can.

556
00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:23.622
If you are willing to guide it.

557
00:44:23.693 --> 00:44:25.558
To nurture it.

558
00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:27.028
To believe in it.

559
00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:29.565
But how? How?

560
00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:31.601
I need your help. Master.

561
00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:35.365
No. you just need to believe.

562
00:44:36.072 --> 00:44:38.370
Promise me. Shifu.

563
00:44:38.975 --> 00:44:41.671
Promise me you will believe.

564
00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:45.306
I will try.

565
00:44:46.149 --> 00:44:47.639
Good.

566
00:44:49.819 --> 00:44:51.878
My time has come.

567
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:58.459
You must continue
your journey without me.

568
00:44:58.562 --> 00:45:00.257
What are you? Wait!

569
00:45:02.365 --> 00:45:03.662
Master!

570
00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:06.059
You can't leave me!

571
00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:12.467
You must believe.

572
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.002
Master!

573
00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:48.104
Yeah. so I'm like.
"Fine. you may be a wolf.

574
00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:51.113
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province...

575
00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:53.279
...but you're a lousy tipper."

576
00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.285
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

577
00:45:57.153 --> 00:45:59.451
I mean. I didn't actually say that...

578
00:45:59.789 --> 00:46:01.256
...but I thought it...

579
00:46:01.324 --> 00:46:03.087
...in my mind.

580
00:46:03.159 --> 00:46:06.219
If he could read my mind.
he'd be. like. "What?"

581
00:46:06.796 --> 00:46:08.957
Order up! Hope you like it.

582
00:46:10.867 --> 00:46:14.098
- This is really good!
- No. come on.

583
00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:18.470
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

584
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:20.941
What do you mean? This is amazing!

585
00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:23.946
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

586
00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.914
Tigress. you've got to try this.

587
00:46:25.982 --> 00:46:29.611
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months

588
00:46:29.686 --> 00:46:34.487
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf
and the energy of the universe.

589
00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:39.761
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

590
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:44.823
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

591
00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:52.333
- What?
- Nothing... Master Shifu.

592
00:46:55.111 --> 00:46:59.138
Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you
lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

593
00:47:00.383 --> 00:47:03.819
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

594
00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:06.720
Work hard. panda. and maybe someday...

595
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.690
...you will have ears like mine.

596
00:47:10.293 --> 00:47:11.692
That's good.

597
00:47:12.295 --> 00:47:15.696
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

598
00:47:16.032 --> 00:47:17.158
It's Shifu!

599
00:47:17.233 --> 00:47:20.066
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

600
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:23.463
Master Shifu!

601
00:47:26.509 --> 00:47:28.204
You think this is funny?

602
00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:31.247
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

603
00:47:31.314 --> 00:47:33.612
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll.

604
00:47:33.683 --> 00:47:36.049
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

605
00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:42.351
And I was saying
you got no sense of humor.

606
00:47:42.425 --> 00:47:44.723
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

607
00:47:44.794 --> 00:47:47.627
What? You're serious? And I have to?

608
00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:52.468
Master Oogway will stop him.
like he did before.

609
00:47:52.535 --> 00:47:54.059
Oogway cannot!

610
00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:55.970
Not anymore.

611
00:47:57.474 --> 00:48:00.170
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

612
00:48:00.243 --> 00:48:01.870
- The panda?
- Yes. the panda!

613
00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:05.540
Master. let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

614
00:48:05.615 --> 00:48:09.176
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

615
00:48:09.252 --> 00:48:10.844
It is his!

616
00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.046
Where'd he go?

617
00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:22.695
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

618
00:48:22.766 --> 00:48:24.324
Watch me.

619
00:48:26.936 --> 00:48:28.028
Come on.

620
00:48:28.104 --> 00:48:31.938
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

621
00:48:32.008 --> 00:48:35.000
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

622
00:48:35.812 --> 00:48:39.077
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

623
00:48:39.149 --> 00:48:42.141
From the beginning.
you've tried to get rid of me.

624
00:48:42.218 --> 00:48:44.550
Yes! I was.

625
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:49.752
But now I ask you to trust in your
master as I have come to trust in mine.

626
00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:54.558
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

627
00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:58.965
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew
I wanted you gone. yet you stayed.

628
00:48:59.068 --> 00:49:01.093
Yeah. I stayed.

629
00:49:01.137 --> 00:49:04.903
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

630
00:49:04.974 --> 00:49:09.377
or said I smelled. it hurt.
but it could never hurt more

631
00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:12.677
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

632
00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:17.984
I stayed because I thought.
if anyone could change me...

633
00:49:18.321 --> 00:49:21.381
...could make me... not me...

634
00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:22.823
...it was you.

635
00:49:23.059 --> 00:49:26.028
The greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

636
00:49:26.095 --> 00:49:27.687
But I can change you!

637
00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:31.291
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

638
00:49:31.367 --> 00:49:35.360
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

639
00:49:35.438 --> 00:49:38.839
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here. how are you...

640
00:49:38.908 --> 00:49:43.174
...gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

641
00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:46.471
How?

642
00:49:48.117 --> 00:49:49.106
How?

643
00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:54.350
- How?!
- I don't know!

644
00:50:02.398 --> 00:50:03.956
I don't know.

645
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.770
That's what I thought.

646
00:50:51.414 --> 00:50:53.575
This is what you trained me for.

647
00:51:00.723 --> 00:51:01.712
Tigress!

648
00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:07.759
Don't try and stop me.

649
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.024
We're not trying to stop you.

650
00:51:12.101 --> 00:51:13.090
What?

651
00:51:13.169 --> 00:51:15.034
We're coming with you!

652
00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:31.738
What? I eat when I'm upset. OK?

653
00:52:32.982 --> 00:52:34.347
No need to explain.

654
00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:38.581
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides
his almond cookies on the top shelf.

655
00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:01.204
Don't tell Monkey.

656
00:53:01.277 --> 00:53:04.440
- Look at you.
- Yeah. I know. I disgust you.

657
00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:07.506
No. I mean. how did you get up there?

658
00:53:07.583 --> 00:53:10.347
I don't know. I guess that...

659
00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.985
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

660
00:53:13.056 --> 00:53:14.956
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

661
00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:18.324
And you have done a perfect spilt.

662
00:53:18.394 --> 00:53:21.363
No. this? This is just...

663
00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:23.429
...an accident.

664
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:30.730
There are no accidents.

665
00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:31.865
Come with me.

666
00:53:39.882 --> 00:53:43.318
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey...

667
00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:46.116
...but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

668
00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:58.500
You dragged me...

669
00:53:58.601 --> 00:54:00.296
...all the way out here...

670
00:54:00.336 --> 00:54:01.667
...for a bath?

671
00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:06.639
Panda...

672
00:54:06.709 --> 00:54:10.338
...we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

673
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.605
The Pool of...

674
00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:15.276
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries...

675
00:54:15.351 --> 00:54:17.546
...of harmony and focus.

676
00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:20.145
This is the birthplace...

677
00:54:20.223 --> 00:54:21.485
...of kung fu.

678
00:54:35.471 --> 00:54:37.735
Do you want to learn kung fu?

679
00:54:37.807 --> 00:54:38.796
Yeah!

680
00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:42.140
Then I am your master!

681
00:54:42.211 --> 00:54:43.974
OK!

682
00:54:45.314 --> 00:54:46.406
Don't cry.

683
00:54:46.482 --> 00:54:47.813
OK.

684
00:54:53.556 --> 00:54:55.547
When you focus on kung fu.

685
00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:57.752
when you concentrate...

686
00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.327
...you stink.

687
00:54:59.362 --> 00:55:01.262
Perhaps that is my fault.

688
00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.788
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

689
00:55:04.867 --> 00:55:07.961
I now see that the way
to get through to you...

690
00:55:08.037 --> 00:55:09.334
...is with this.

691
00:55:09.405 --> 00:55:12.169
Oh. great. 'cause I am hungry.

692
00:55:13.075 --> 00:55:14.133
Good.

693
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.906
When you have been trained. you may eat.

694
00:55:18.347 --> 00:55:19.507
Let us begin.

695
00:56:30.219 --> 00:56:31.311
After you. panda.

696
00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:33.355
Just like that?

697
00:56:33.422 --> 00:56:37.085
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

698
00:56:37.159 --> 00:56:41.653
I vowed to train you. and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

699
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:48.661
Enjoy.

700
00:56:50.239 --> 00:56:51.672
Hey!

701
00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:54.869
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

702
00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:57.679
Hey!

703
00:57:03.953 --> 00:57:05.921
You are free to eat.

704
00:57:05.988 --> 00:57:07.888
- Am I?!
- Are you?!

705
00:58:34.276 --> 00:58:35.800
I'm not hungry.

706
00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:40.609
Master.

707
00:59:10.746 --> 00:59:12.043
Out it!

708
00:59:29.265 --> 00:59:31.062
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

709
00:59:31.133 --> 00:59:34.125
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

710
00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:36.398
You think I'm a fool?

711
00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:40.101
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

712
00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:43.441
I heard how he fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

713
00:59:43.512 --> 00:59:47.949
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

714
00:59:48.017 --> 00:59:53.614
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

715
00:59:53.689 --> 00:59:56.783
Finally. a worthy opponent.

716
00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:59.350
Our battle will be legendary!

717
01:00:19.348 --> 01:00:21.043
We've got this. Help her.

718
01:00:45.674 --> 01:00:46.663
Monkey!

719
01:00:46.742 --> 01:00:48.573
Go!

720
01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:49.838
What was I thinking?!

721
01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.280
Mantis!

722
01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:07.962
Now!

723
01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:56.174
Shifu taught you well.

724
01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:01.082
But he didn't teach you everything.

725
01:02:05.187 --> 01:02:06.677
You have done well. panda.

726
01:02:06.755 --> 01:02:10.452
Done well? Done well?

727
01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:11.823
I've done awesome!

728
01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:16.726
The mark of a true hero is humility.

729
01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:19.495
But. yes. you have done...

730
01:02:20.102 --> 01:02:21.433
...awesome.

731
01:02:28.677 --> 01:02:32.010
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!

732
01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:35.517
No. they're breathing. They're asleep?
But their eyes are open.

733
01:02:35.584 --> 01:02:37.575
We were no match for his nerve attach.

734
01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:39.883
He's gotten stronger.

735
01:02:39.955 --> 01:02:42.253
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

736
01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:44.448
He's too fast!

737
01:02:44.526 --> 01:02:46.084
Sorry. Po.

738
01:02:48.163 --> 01:02:49.721
I thought we could stop him.

739
01:02:49.798 --> 01:02:51.629
He could have killed you.

740
01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.758
Why didn't he?

741
01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:57.238
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

742
01:02:57.339 --> 01:03:01.639
It might. I mean. a little.

743
01:03:01.677 --> 01:03:02.905
I'm pretty scared.

744
01:03:02.978 --> 01:03:04.468
You can defeat him. panda!

745
01:03:04.546 --> 01:03:07.481
Are you kidding? If they can't?!

746
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:10.541
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

747
01:03:10.619 --> 01:03:13.986
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

748
01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:21.819
You really believe I'm ready?

749
01:03:21.897 --> 01:03:23.558
You are...

750
01:03:23.632 --> 01:03:24.929
...Po.

751
01:04:13.882 --> 01:04:17.443
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

752
01:04:17.519 --> 01:04:19.453
It is yours.

753
01:04:19.521 --> 01:04:22.456
Wait. What happens when I read it?

754
01:04:22.524 --> 01:04:26.551
Legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

755
01:04:26.628 --> 01:04:28.858
Really? That's cool.

756
01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.764
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

757
01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:34.735
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

758
01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.837
Can I punch through walls?

759
01:04:36.905 --> 01:04:39.271
- Do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

760
01:04:39.341 --> 01:04:40.535
- Will I?
- Focus.

761
01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:42.342
- Focus.
- Oh. yeah. yeah.

762
01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:45.312
Read it. Po. and fulfill your destiny.

763
01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.576
Read it and become...

764
01:04:47.649 --> 01:04:49.378
...the Dragon Warrior.

765
01:04:56.291 --> 01:04:57.724
It's impossible to open.

766
01:04:58.694 --> 01:05:01.925
OK. Come on. baby. Come on now.

767
01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.793
Thank you.

768
01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:08.268
I probably loosened it up
for you though.

769
01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:11.095
OK. here goes.

770
01:05:23.118 --> 01:05:24.779
- It's blank.
- What?!

771
01:05:24.853 --> 01:05:28.448
- Here. look.
- No. I am forbidden to look upon...

772
01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:37.030
Blank. I don't...

773
01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:39.293
I don't understand.

774
01:05:40.602 --> 01:05:43.298
OK. So. like...

775
01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:46.603
...Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

776
01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:49.269
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

777
01:05:49.344 --> 01:05:53.405
Oh. come on! Face it.
he picked me by accident.

778
01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:57.612
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

779
01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:00.349
But who will stop Tai Lung?

780
01:06:00.422 --> 01:06:02.913
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

781
01:06:02.991 --> 01:06:04.652
No.

782
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:10.489
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

783
01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:12.966
- What about you. Master?
- I will fight him.

784
01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:15.731
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

785
01:06:15.804 --> 01:06:17.271
for everyone to escape.

786
01:06:17.339 --> 01:06:19.773
But. Shifu. he'll kill you.

787
01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:22.675
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

788
01:06:23.645 --> 01:06:25.738
Listen to me. all of you.

789
01:06:25.814 --> 01:06:29.341
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

790
01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:32.410
I am very proud
to have been your master.

791
01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:55.574
We've got to get them out safely.

792
01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:57.976
Come. little one. Let's find your mama.

793
01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.572
Viper. gather the southern farmers.
Mantis. the north.

794
01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:03.380
Orange. light the way.

795
01:07:22.437 --> 01:07:25.463
Look. it's the Dragon Warrior.

796
01:07:34.182 --> 01:07:35.581
Hey. Dad.

797
01:07:36.184 --> 01:07:37.481
Po!

798
01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:45.485
Good to have you back. son.

799
01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.453
Good to be back.

800
01:07:49.531 --> 01:07:51.158
Let's go. Po.

801
01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:56.502
So for our next shop.
it's time to face it...

802
01:07:56.772 --> 01:08:00.264
...the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables...

803
01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:02.702
...no longer slices.

804
01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:06.214
Also. I was thinking. maybe this time

805
01:08:06.281 --> 01:08:09.444
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

806
01:08:10.752 --> 01:08:11.946
You like that?

807
01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:22.689
Po. I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

808
01:08:22.764 --> 01:08:25.790
It just wasn't meant to be.

809
01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:31.762
Po. forget everything else.

810
01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.035
Your destiny still awaits.

811
01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:38.876
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

812
01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:41.245
I don't know. Dad.

813
01:08:41.316 --> 01:08:45.309
Honestly. sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

814
01:08:48.690 --> 01:08:49.782
Po...

815
01:08:49.858 --> 01:08:54.295
...I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

816
01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.422
...a long time ago.

817
01:08:56.498 --> 01:08:58.227
OK.

818
01:08:59.601 --> 01:09:03.731
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

819
01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:11.105
Come here. The secret ingredient is...

820
01:09:11.179 --> 01:09:12.168
...nothing.

821
01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.083
You heard me. Nothing!

822
01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:18.619
There is no secret ingredient!

823
01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:21.747
Wait. wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

824
01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.690
You don't add some kind of special
sauce or something?

825
01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.163
Don't have to. To make something
special. you just believe it's special.

826
01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.332
There is no secret ingredient.

827
01:10:04.933 --> 01:10:07.731
I have come home. Master.

828
01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:11.068
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

829
01:10:11.139 --> 01:10:15.075
Oh. yes. You have a new favorite.

830
01:10:15.143 --> 01:10:18.237
So where is this Po?

831
01:10:19.681 --> 01:10:20.909
Did I scare him off?

832
01:10:20.982 --> 01:10:23.314
This battle is between you and me.

833
01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.156
So. that is how it's going to be.

834
01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:30.248
That is how it must be.

835
01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:48.968
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

836
01:10:49.044 --> 01:10:51.410
Obeying your master is not weakness!

837
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.278
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

838
01:10:54.349 --> 01:10:56.510
You always knew.

839
01:10:56.585 --> 01:11:01.522
But when Oogway said otherwise.
what did you do?

840
01:11:02.657 --> 01:11:05.182
What did you do?!

841
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:08.855
Nothing!

842
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:11.763
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

843
01:11:11.833 --> 01:11:13.801
Not your fault?!

844
01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:15.928
Who filled my head with dreams?!

845
01:11:16.004 --> 01:11:18.234
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?!

846
01:11:18.306 --> 01:11:21.036
Who denied me my destiny?!

847
01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:32.879
It was never my decision to make!

848
01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.657
It is now.

849
01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:48.499
Give me the scroll!

850
01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:49.798
I would rather die.

851
01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:43.049
All I ever did. I did to make you proud!

852
01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:45.716
Tell me how proud you are. Shifu!

853
01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.185
Tell me!

854
01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:50.459
Tell me!

855
01:13:00.775 --> 01:13:04.142
I have...
I have always been proud of you.

856
01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.613
From the first moment. I've been...

857
01:13:08.683 --> 01:13:10.981
...proud of you.

858
01:13:11.052 --> 01:13:13.418
And it was my pride...

859
01:13:13.488 --> 01:13:15.513
...that blinded me.

860
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:19.151
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming...

861
01:13:20.161 --> 01:13:22.425
...what I...

862
01:13:22.497 --> 01:13:24.488
...was turning you into.

863
01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.268
I'm...

864
01:13:27.335 --> 01:13:28.324
I'm sorry.

865
01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:39.575
I don't want your apology.

866
01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:41.172
I want my scroll!

867
01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:45.617
What?!

868
01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:46.915
Where is it?!

869
01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:52.519
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

870
01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:56.790
You will never see
that scroll. Tai Lung.

871
01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:58.196
Never.

872
01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:00.123
Never.

873
01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:08.372
Stairs.

874
01:14:10.812 --> 01:14:12.609
Who are you?

875
01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:17.709
Buddy. I am the Dragon Warrior.

876
01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:22.053
You?

877
01:14:23.024 --> 01:14:24.992
Him? He's a panda.

878
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:28.928
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do. big guy? Sit on me?

879
01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.931
Don't tempt me.

880
01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:35.026
No. I'm gonna use this.

881
01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:36.730
You want it? Come and get it.

882
01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:39.770
Finally!

883
01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:07.201
That scroll is mine!

884
01:16:00.955 --> 01:16:01.979
Lightning!

885
01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:39.183
The scroll has given him power!

886
01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:41.386
No!

887
01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:21.802
Finally! Oh. yes.

888
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:26.739
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

889
01:17:31.045 --> 01:17:33.070
It's nothing!

890
01:17:35.049 --> 01:17:37.643
It's OK. I didn't get it
the first time. either.

891
01:17:38.419 --> 01:17:39.443
What?

892
01:17:40.688 --> 01:17:42.485
There is no secret ingredient.

893
01:17:46.027 --> 01:17:47.255
It's just you.

894
01:17:57.038 --> 01:17:58.096
Stop it!

895
01:17:58.173 --> 01:17:59.936
I'm gonna pee.

896
01:18:01.509 --> 01:18:03.136
Don't.

897
01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:04.872
Don't! Don't!

898
01:19:12.146 --> 01:19:13.943
You...

899
01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:16.245
...can't defeat me.

900
01:19:20.688 --> 01:19:21.916
You...

901
01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:25.055
...you're just a big...

902
01:19:25.126 --> 01:19:26.718
...fat...

903
01:19:26.794 --> 01:19:27.783
...panda!

904
01:19:28.763 --> 01:19:31.891
I'm not a big fat panda.

905
01:19:31.966 --> 01:19:34.264
I'm the big fat panda.

906
01:19:36.537 --> 01:19:37.970
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

907
01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.472
Oh. you know this hold?

908
01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:43.499
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

909
01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:45.273
Nope.

910
01:19:45.346 --> 01:19:47.541
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

911
01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:09.297
Look!

912
01:20:10.338 --> 01:20:12.431
The Dragon Warrior.

913
01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:44.770
That's my boy! That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

914
01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:47.933
Yes!

915
01:20:49.210 --> 01:20:50.768
Thanks. Dad.

916
01:21:00.054 --> 01:21:01.453
Hey. guys.

917
01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:07.525
Master.

918
01:21:07.595 --> 01:21:09.028
Master.

919
01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:13.696
Master?

920
01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:15.235
Master Shifu!

921
01:21:28.282 --> 01:21:29.647
Master!

922
01:21:29.717 --> 01:21:31.810
Shifu. are you OK?!

923
01:21:34.188 --> 01:21:35.587
Po.

924
01:21:35.656 --> 01:21:37.590
You're alive.

925
01:21:37.658 --> 01:21:38.886
Or we're both dead.

926
01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.896
No. Master. I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

927
01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:44.090
You did?

928
01:21:48.369 --> 01:21:54.103
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

929
01:21:54.175 --> 01:21:57.667
You are the Dragon Warrior.

930
01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:00.881
You have brought peace...

931
01:22:00.948 --> 01:22:03.712
...to this valley...

932
01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:05.980
...and...

933
01:22:06.053 --> 01:22:07.680
...and to me.

934
01:22:07.755 --> 01:22:09.017
Thank you.

935
01:22:10.858 --> 01:22:14.089
Thank you. Po.

936
01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:16.756
Thank you. Thank you.

937
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:27.264
No! Master! No. no. no.
don't die. Shifu. please!

938
01:22:27.341 --> 01:22:30.071
I'm not dying. you idiot!

939
01:22:30.144 --> 01:22:32.112
Dragon Warrior...

940
01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:38.216
...I am simply at peace. Finally.

941
01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:43.890
So. I should stop talking?

942
01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.219
If you can.

943
01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.904
Want to get something to eat?

944
01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:09.675
Yeah.

945
01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:19.091
Everybody is kung fu fighting

946
01:23:19.927 --> 01:23:23.260
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

947
01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:27.598
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

948
01:23:28.769 --> 01:23:32.261
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

949
01:23:35.376 --> 01:23:38.436
Everybody is kung fu fighting

950
01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:42.945
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

951
01:23:43.951 --> 01:23:47.284
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

952
01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:51.615
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

953
01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:55.656
You are a natural

954
01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.960
Why is that so hard to see?

955
01:23:58.065 --> 01:24:02.195
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me

956
01:24:02.236 --> 01:24:06.332
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know

957
01:24:06.407 --> 01:24:10.309
But sometimes you've got to go
And be your own hero

958
01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:13.313
Everybody is kung fu fighting

959
01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:17.879
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

960
01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:22.321
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

961
01:24:23.424 --> 01:24:26.655
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

962
01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:32.629
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

963
01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:36.796
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

964
01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:40.671
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

965
01:24:40.741 --> 01:24:45.110
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

966
01:24:45.179 --> 01:24:48.307
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

967
01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:52.643
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

968
01:24:53.854 --> 01:24:56.982
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

969
01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:01.487
It's the book of your life

970
01:25:03.297 --> 01:25:06.892
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

971
01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:12.095
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

972
01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:16.200
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

973
01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:20.043
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

974
01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:23.208
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

975
01:25:24.752 --> 01:25:27.812
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:32.054
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

977
01:25:33.494 --> 01:25:36.986
It's the book of your life
that you're writing
